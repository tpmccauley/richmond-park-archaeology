"Richmond Park [Two-Storm Wood], London {","An enclosure, forming the boundries of Deanes Coppice, was recorded through field survey by T Greeves in 1991.  The coppice was first recorded in the 17th century.  An ancient oak marks the north-east corner of the coppice and may have had this function when the enclosure was laid out.

The enclosure is cut at its southern end by the modern road.  The enclosure was delimited on the west side by Deanes Lane (GLHER 021348), on its north side by an incomplete bank measuring c 65m in length and on its east side by a bank measuring c 115m in length, which is continued by a recut scarp for another 75m southwards to the road.

The bank on the north side measures c 4m in width and 0.3m in height.  The bank on the east side measures c 0.4m in height.  A feature within the enclosure may be a building (GLHER 021350).

"Richmond Park [Two-Storm Wood], London {Medieval open field system}","Earthwork remains of a medieval open field system were identified through field survey carried out by T Greeves in Richmond Park in 1991. The area recorded forms part of Mortlake Upper Town field.

The area of the field system measures c 450m by 300m and is centred at TQ 201 741.  Vestigial evidence for plough headlands was found on the north and south sides of Warple Way.  Other evidence for the field system includes slight traces of ridge and furrow on either side of Warple Way.  The ridges that survive well enough to be measured appear to have had an original width of between c 8m and 11m.  The ridges survive to a maximum height of only 0.2m.

"Roehampton Lane, Parkstead House {Also Known as Manresa House, 18th Century Villa}","PLAN: rectangular C18 villa faces west with intact C18 plan on ground and first floors; single storey C19 corridor to the east connecting villa to flanking C19 wings to north and south. Further ranges, running east from the corridor, form a courtyard closed by a block of c2004 on the east side. Former chapel is to the south of south courtyard range; a chapel of c2004 is further to the east, accessed through the east courtyard range. There is a third block of c2004 to the north, an extension of the north courtyard range. 

EXTERIOR: The villa's principal façade is an excellent example of a mid-C18 villa, inspired by the houses of the Italian Veneto. The brick building is faced with Portland stone and of five bays and three storeys. It demonstrates those features characteristic of the Italian villas it emulated, including a rusticated ground floor and a central six-column Ionic pedimented loggia with a balustrade at first floor. This is reached by grand twin curved flights of steps with wrought iron railings. There is also a central entrance at basement level with a carved entablature. The rear, typically for a building of the C18, is relatively plain and a single storey corridor of 1860 partially obscures the elevation. The fenestration is regular with a clock set into the central window, introduced by the Jesuits in the C19. 

The north and south elevations of the villa are obscured by C19 additions. To the south is a five bay wing of 1860 by H Clutton, in the Italian palazzo style, of stock brick with stone dressings, including a rusticated plinth and quoins. The chapel, behind the south wing was begun in 1860 by JJ Scoles and completed after his death by Nicholl, has a nave with aisles and an apsidal east end. To the north is a wing, added by the Jesuits slightly later; this has eight bays, five in the centre projecting, and is of stock brick with stone surrounds to the central windows, voussoirs to the ground floor windows and quoins. Adjoining this is a new building, built c2004, housing teaching rooms and a café. Running east from the villa are two ranges creating a courtyard to the rear of 1877-8 (south) and 1885-6 (north) by FA Walters. That to the north abuts the c2004 block. The courtyard is enclosed to the east by an entrance wing of c2004. There are now free-standing blocks in the area to the east of the house, built in c2004, and a new chapel to the south of the Jesuit chapel, which is connected to the C19 block by a small link corridor.

SETTING: The 1760s villa faces west and has a view over Richmond Park, as uninterrupted as it was when Lord Bessborough first selected the site in 1762. This remarkable feature is invaluable in evoking the landscape setting that inspired so many aristocrats and gentlemen to build small villas in this area in the Georgian period. No other surviving C18 Thames-side house retains its original setting in the same way, although the area to the east of Parkstead House has changed beyond recognition. 

INTERIOR: Of exceptional significance for the survival of Chambers' decorative scheme; including fireplaces, door-cases, a central staircase and plasterwork ceilings (the latter most complete of his early works). The most elaborate fireplace, in the central hall, is of marble carved by Joseph Wilton and has a raised centre, swags and trophies of the arts. Other fireplaces by Chambers in the principal reception rooms are equally fine, though not as grand. The ceilings are of considerable significance and are described in detail in The Buildings of England: London, South p. 693. The staircase, which rises along three sides of the hall, is also of particular note in having a wrought-iron carved balustrade and elaborate plasterwork friezes that are typical of Chambers' work. The staircase originally had an octagonal servants' stair within its central well, which has since been removed, depriving the plan-form of its principal feature of interest. The ingenuity of this solution to making the most of the space within a compact building is not repeated elsewhere in the house, although the arrangement remains of intrinsic special interest as an example of a C18 villa plan. The basement floor of the Chambers' villa has narrow passageways leading to small rooms. Of note are the floral plasterwork on the corridor walls and the use of a medallion motif with heads and prows in the ceilings. The same pattern is repeated on a C18 circular skylight on the second floor. There is a good level of survival of original doors, door-cases and windows on the second floor, although the plan has been altered and fireplaces removed.

Also of exceptional special interest are the William Morris and Company stained glass windows and reredos, imported in 2004. Originally pointed lancets, the fifteen windows were altered to round-headed to suit the Romanesque style of the Putney chapel. Twelve of the windows, depicting female saints, were funded by donations from graduating students; they are now situated in the corridor of the north wing in the courtyard, lit from a smaller inner courtyard to the north. The windows form an obvious group, each depicting a tall female figure with a small face and hands on alternating red and blue backgrounds. All are characterised by the serenity of the figures, although each is distinguished by the symbols of their martyrdom illustrated in the glass. The other three windows, formerly at the east end of the chapels at Chelsea and Putney, are in a small corridor leading from the southern wing to the new chapel, built to the east of the original chapel in 2004. They were commissioned as a memorial to a Head Governess who died in a road accident. The central window depicts Christ the Saviour of the World, and the other two the Virgin Mary and Mary Magdalene, the latter the only Morris design in the ensemble. The reredos was designed by William Morris and is now in a lecture theatre in the c2004 buildings to the north of the site. This is a rectangular trellis supporting square panels of carved oak. Most panels display curling foliage but four contain the creatures associated with of the four Evangelists and the central two depict arrows, symbolic of the martyrdom of St Ursula, the College's patron saint. A cornice bears the Latin inscription 'hoc facite in meam commemorationem' meaning 'Do this in remembrance of me', words taken from I Corinthians 11. The design and craftsmanship of the reredos, particular in the use of silver and gold to reflect light, are of a very high quality. 

The interiors of the C19 sections retain a number of original features which are of special interest. The finest interior of the C19 work is the chapel, which is in the Italian Renaissance style with marble pilasters and colourful paintwork. The aisle bays contain sky-lit coffered domes and the barrel vaulted nave ceiling is pierced by a row of clerestory lights. The adjacent former vestry has an elaborate frieze and pedimented door cases. Also of note is the single storey corridor to the rear of the Chambers' villa, which is largely unaltered and has a handsome colonnade of Doric pillars. Other corridors contain pilasters and pedimented door cases. There are several fireplaces, some bearing the Jesuits' insignias: 'HIS' and 'AMDG'. On the first floor of the south wing are small cell-like rooms, once accommodation for the Jesuit residents. 

HISTORY: The history of Parkstead House falls neatly into three phases. The original building was built from 1762 to designs by Sir William Chambers as a riverside villa for Lord Bessborough. Designs for surviving ceilings can be dated to 1761 and 1763 and the house was complete by 1768. Then, in 1860, two wings and a chapel for the Society of Jesus were added, creating a horseshoe courtyard to the rear of Chambers' villa and replacing Chambers' wings (which are illustrated in Vitruvius Britannicus IV). Finally, when the house passed into educational use in the 20th century, the courtyard was enclosed with the addition of a fourth wing, firstly by a building of 1949 then by a new foyer built c2004. At this time, the fifteen stained glass windows and a reredos by William Morris and Company were installed in the building. 

Sir William Chambers is an architect of exceptional significance, the designer of Somerset House and an important figure in the C18 neo-classical movement. This was the first of several villas designed by Chambers in the 1760s and owes its form and type to Lord Burlington's Chiswick House of 1728. Foot's Clay, a villa in Kent built by Bourchier Cleeve in 1756 in an imitation of Palladio's Villa Rotunda, has also been cited as an influence on Chambers' design (by Pevsner). 

The William Morris and Company stained glass was commissioned by Whitelands College in the 1880s for their first chapel in Chelsea and subsequently moved with them to Putney in 1930 and then to Parkstead in 2004. In 1883, John Ruskin wrote to Edward Burne-Jones on behalf of the 'Principal, Governesses and Scholars of Whitelands College' and secured his, and William Morris', personal involvement in the commission. Fourteen of the windows were designed by Burne-Jones, one by Morris, and all were crafted by Morris at the Merton Abbey Works. Five of the windows (saints Agnes, Celia, Catherine, Dorothy and Margaret) were from pre-existing Burne-Jones designs; the rest were designed specifically for the College. The reredos was commissioned 1886 and designed by Morris. It was crafted by Kate Faulkner at her studio in Bloomsbury. In a letter she described how the surface was treated with silver and then gold paint in order that 'every part, even the lowest relief, catches the light, reflects it ? [and] even strong colours have been used freely'. (1-2)

Manresa House had become a Jesuit college (with an associated cemetery - see MLO77881) by 1865 and remained so until after the Second World War, during which the south wing of the house was destroyed by a direct hit from a bomb.  Part of the estate was compulsorilly purchased for the construction of the Alton Estate.  The last Jesuit priest was interred there in 1962, the year in which the Society sold the property to London County Council.  Since then the property has been used by various education establishments.  (3)<br/><br/>Status: Listed Building - I [14/07/55]<br/>Listing Record source: Parkstead House.

"Roehampton Lane, {Roehampton Garden}","DESCRIPTION

LOCATION, AREA, BOUNDARIES, LANDFORM, SETTING
The level 7ha site is situated in the outskirts of west London. Barnes is 2km to the north, Wandsworth town 4km to the east, Wimbledon Park 3km to the south-east, and Richmond Park c 1km to the south-west. Grove House is bounded by Roehampton Lane to the east and Clarence Lane to the south. Buildings of the convent of the Sacred Heart (Digby Stewart College) provide the boundary to the north-east, and the grounds of Roehampton Golf Club (the former parkland) the boundary to the west.

ENTRANCES AND APPROACHES
The drive remains as laid out in the late 18th century, entering the estate at the early 19th century lodge (listed grade II) and gates (listed grade II but possibly not original) which stand at the south-east corner of the site, off Roehampton Lane. The drive leads north-west to the south front of the House, beyond which it curves south-west to join Clarence Lane at a mid 19th century lodge c 250m west of the House. This lodge is possibly the 'gardener's cottage', for which sketches by William Wilkinson Wardell, dated 1854, exist. Several late 20th century buildings occupy the area between the south-west arm of the drive and Clarence Lane.

PRINCIPAL BUILDING
Grove House (listed grade II*), originally Roehampton Grove and subsequently Upper Grove House, replaced a 17th century building, Roehampton Great House. It was built by James Wyatt for Joshua Vanneck (d 1816) sometime after his marriage in 1777 and before 1787. The two-storey house has a pedimented centre and balustraded portico at ground-floor level. The garden front (to the north) has a three-storey, three-windowed splayed bay to the centre which is surmounted by a balustraded parapet which is echoed in the east and west wings.

Overlooking the lake to the north, Grove House was little altered until the C20 when, c 1912, the owner, Charles L Fischer, undertook extensive alterations which included re-casing the whole of the north front in stone and adding an arcaded walk along its eastern section. Minor alterations were also made to the eastern front, and it could be that it was at this time that this side of the House was stuccoed.

GARDENS AND PLEASURE GROUNDS
Between the House and the southern boundary is an area of lawn, bordered by mature trees (which include a collection of conifers) and shrubs, the main gardens being on the north side of the House. These were laid out in the mid 18th century to accompany the new house (Manning and Bray 1814). Immediately below the House to the north is a stone-paved terrace, edged with a balustrade, from which three sets of steps lead north down to the gardens. These form a rectangular area, extended on its northern edge by a semicircular bow, the whole being enclosed by a low stone wall decorated with urns. A raised walk leads down the eastern side, and the main area is laid out with gravel walks through grass plats. At the centre of the semicircle is a round pond and fountain, and from here a path leads north across the surrounding lawns.

A straight path extends east from the top terrace. A little further to the east of this is a lightly wooded pleasure ground which provides the setting for the mausoleum (listed grade II), built in the early 1860s by William Burn for Yolande Lyne-Stephens, in memory of her husband (d 1860). The stone-faced mausoleum has fine Romanesque-style detail.

A path extends north from the pleasure grounds to the east end of the kidney-shaped lake. This was enlarged by Vanneck in the late 18th century from an existing smaller body of water, and the balustraded sham bridge (listed grade II) at the west end was built at the same time. The inlet at the eastern end of the lake is marked by 'Rooks Grotto'. Constructed in the late 1890s by T B Harpham, horticultural builder, of Edgeware Road, for the then-owner Raoul Bedingfeld, the Grotto, made from a variety of natural and artificial stones, originally included caverns, rocky paths, and a waterfall running into the lake. At the northern tip of the lake the path forks, one branch continuing north as a walk through a strip of woodland alongside Roehampton Lane, the other looping round the northern edges of the water and so back to the west side of the gardens.

Leading south from the south-west corner of the House to the southern boundary is a yew hedge, incorporating stone piers at intervals along it. This boundary probably dates from the mid 19th century alterations to the House and grounds.

OTHER LAND
To the west of the House (outside the area here registered) are a number of free-standing late 20th century buildings associated with the present Institute. Beyond (also outside the area here registered) is an area of playing fields.

The former park, which lies to the north-west, is now a golf course and, like the playing fields, is outside the boundary of the registered site from which it is screened by a band of mature woodland.

The kitchen garden, now infilled with 20th century buildings, stands on Roehampton Lane c 100m to the north-east of the House and is outside the registered boundary.

Summary of Building

Monument to the fallen of the First World War from South Africa. Designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens, unveiled by General JC Smuts in June 1921. 

Reasons for Designation

The South African War Memorial in Richmond Cemetery is designated at Grade II for the following principal reasons: *Design interest: granite cenotaph, designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens, inscribed in both English and Dutch; *Historic interest: erected by The South African Hospital and Comforts Fund Committee to commemorate the thirty-nine South African soldiers who were buried in Richmond Cemetery, close to the South African Hospital (later the South African Military Hospital) that was initially based in Richmond Park. It became a focus for pilgrimage in the 1920s and '30s.
 
History

The South African War Memorial was designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens and unveiled by General JC Smuts in June 1921. The design derives from Lutyens? Cenotaph in Whitehall of 1919-20 (listed Grade I).

In order to provide care for the large number of South African troops serving in the First World War, the South African Hospital was established in Richmond Park in June 1916. In July 1918 it was amalgamated with the Richmond Military Hospital to form the South African Military Hospital. The South African Hospital and Comforts Fund Committee decided to erect a memorial to commemorate thirty-nine South African soldiers who were buried in Richmond Cemetery, which was at that time known as ?soldiers corner'. The memorial, which overlooks the graves, is inscribed in both English and Dutch. After it was unveiled by General Smuts in 1921 it became the focus of South African pilgrimage throughout the 1920s and 1930s. In 1981 the Commonwealth War Graves Commission became aware of its existence and agreed to maintain the memorial on behalf of the South African Government.

Lutyens designed the large Rand Regiments Memorial in Johannesburg (1910) which was his first war memorial.

Richmond Cemetery is unusually endowed with war memorials and war graves since it also includes the burial ground for the Royal Star and Garter Home. The Bromhead Memorial was erected in 1957 in memory of those from the Home who are not otherwise commemorated.

Sir Edwin Lutyens OM RA (1869-1944) was the leading English architect of his generation. Before the First World War his reputation rested on his country houses and his work at New Delhi, but during and after the war he became the pre-eminent architect for war memorials in England, France and the British Empire. While the Cenotaph in Whitehall (London) had the most influence on other war memorials, the Thiepval Arch was the most influential on other forms of architecture. He designed the Stone of Remembrance which was placed in all Imperial War Graves Commission cemeteries and in some cemeteries in England, including some with which he was not otherwise associated.

Details

Coarse grained granite cenotaph with a slightly flared base set on a similar stone plinth. 

The outward face is inscribed: Union is Strength / Our / Glorious / Dead Below is an inscribed cross.

The inner face, overlooking the group of graves, is inscribed: Eendraght maakt macht / Onzen / Gevallenen / Helden 

In the apex of each face is the head of a springbok in low relief.

The side elevations have a stylised stone wreath at the base and are inscribed to north and south respectively with the dates MCMXIV and MCMXIX.

"Star ad Garter Hill, [ Richmond Park], Richmond, TW10 5HU {18th century Gate Lodge}","This building is listed under the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 as amended for its special architectural or historic interest. The GIS polygon for this site is approximate only.

GV II Richmond Gate Lodge, screen wall, gate piers and gates, designed 1795 and dated 1798, and attributed to Sir John Soane, King's Deputy Surveyor of Woods and Forests.

MATERIALS: Lodge and matching sreen wall are brick-built with a stucco render, lined as ashlar; the lodge has a hipped slate roof. Gate Piers: each is of sandstone on a moulded plinth, with a rusticated ashlar pier,capped by a pyramidal-shaped, deep oversailing moulded cornice. Gates are of wrought iron, with later steel replacements and repairs. Flanking walls are of rendered brick.

PLAN: Richmond Gate is located at the Richmond Hill entrance to Richmond Park. It is oriented north-south and is composed of three sets of gate piers and gates, providing three carriage (or car) entrances,and a narrower pedestrian entrance to each side. The main lodge is on the south side of the gates and at the opposite end is a large screen wall which mirrors the architectural design of the lodge.

EXTERIOR: The Lodge: The main elevation is in five narrow symmetrical bays and treated as two storeys. The central bay on the main elevation contains a two-storey recessed arch with a rectangular entrance set into it. The door, of four panels, sits in a plain moulded architrave. To either side of the door are single ground floor sash windows of eight over eight panes. Above these, in the second storey are shallow horizontal windows of four over four panes. Each outer bay contains a recessed blind round-arched opening at ground floor level, with a recessed blind oculus above. It has a hipped slate roof behind a parapet above a cornice. There is one chimney which is set slightly left of centre on the roof ridge. The return elevation on the north side of the lodge (facing out of the park) is comprised of three symmetrical bays with a single ground floor sash window of eight over eight panes. Above this is a recessed bullseye window. The outer bays contain recessed blind arched openings at ground floor level, with recessed lunettes above. The elevation on the south side of the lodge is treated the same. Images held at Richmond Reference Library also show that in the C19 the lodge had a porch added to it which was probably removed in the C20 and that the blind windows in the screen wall had, at various points, been painted to look like real windows. Attached to the lodge is a single depth stone flag paving which runs the length of the building.

Screen Wall: The screen wall at the opposite end of the gate is given the same architectural treatment as the lodge. Its north and south elevations (facing into and out of the park) mirror the side elevations of the lodge, the only difference being that there are no windows in the central bays, only blind openings. The two structures were clearly designed as a pair, to present a symmetrical composition to be viewed on the approach to the park from Richmond Hill.

Gate piers: There are three pairs of gate piers which create a wide central entrance and two narrower flanking entrances through Richmond Gate. Each pier is square on plan with a moulded plinth and dressed, rusticated ashlar above, topped by a pyramidal-shaped, deep oversailing moulded cornice. Facing towards the outside of the park, the two central-most gate piers bear the initials GR and CR (for George and Charlotte, then King and Queen of England) in wrought iron painted in gold. The two piers to either side of the central-most piers share the date the gates were erected, 1798, in Roman numerals (MDCC and XCVIII). The outer-most gate piers, which enclose the pedestrian gates, are the same height as the plat band on the lodge and screen wall, and are slightly lower in height than the other four piers. Each of these external piers contains an alcove. Attached to the pedestrian gate on the north side, and next to the screen wall, is a second, later C20 gated area, presumably intended to keep the deer from escaping from the park; it is not of special interest.

Gates: Apart from the pedestrian entrances on either end of the gates which are of wrought iron, the central gates appear to be largely a modern replacement, but incorporating elements of earlier gates. All gates have dog bars and spearhead finials. The central gates are flanked by a narrow screen of railings set on a concrete plinth, leading up to the central carriage gate.

Flanking Walls: At either end of the lodge and screen wall are ramped, curved flanking walls which connect to the boundary walls of the park on the south side and to Ancaster House on the north. They are built of brick and rendered on the outer face. They appear to be part of the original design since they join at the pediment and plat bands on the Lodge and screen wall and contribute to the overall symmetrical composition of the gate and lodges as a whole.

INTERIOR: The interior of the lodge was not inspected.

HISTORY: Richmond Gate is the main entrance to Richmond Park, the largest Royal Park in London and designated Grade I on the Register of Parks and Gardens. This thoroughfare through the park was used by road traffic and pedestrians for hundreds of years before the construction of the existing gates and lodge. It provides the main access to the park from the town of Richmond, on the banks of the river Thames. Richmond was the site of the medieval royal palace of Shene, later known as Richmond Palace, and the area became increasingly fashionable in the C18. Richmond Park was enclosed by Charles I in 1637 and to this day the enclosure walls remain, although their fabric has been much renewed over the intervening years. Despite the efforts of members of the Royal Household to restrict public access to the Park, in 1758 public rights of way were upheld and are maintained to this day.

The gate and lodges were constructed by the firm Kent, Claridge & Pierce between 1798-99 to replace an existing wooden gate and ladder-stile entrance. Recent research has attributed Richmond Gate and associated Lodge to the eminent Neoclassical architect John Soane (1753-1837), who designed them in 1795 as the newly-appointed King's Deputy Surveyor of Woods and Forests. Evidence of Soane's initial design, an annotated `Copy Lincoln's Inn Fields Sep 14th 1795' is archived at the Soane Museum in London (Sir John Soane's Museum 62/9/17). These drawings depict gates and a lodge which are architecturally similar to the existing gates, athough not identical.

In 1896 the gates were widened. It was probably at this point that the height of the second set of gate piers was increased to match the height of the central carriage gate piers. Images from around 1900-5 indeed show that the two central pairs of gate piers are the same height and have been moved further apart, with the central carriage gate widened and the screen of railings to either side of the carriage gate converted into two more gates. This allows traffic to enter and exit from three openings in the gate rather than just one. This is still the way the gates are used to this day.

It may be the case that further alterations to the gates took place during WWII when Richmond Park was used extensively by the Ministry of Defence.

HISTORIC DEVELOPMENT

The new Palace of Sheen surrounded by a new royal park was created under Henry V and Henry VI c 1414-54, the palace being rebuilt for Henry VII after a fire destroyed it c 1499. A new and larger royal park, known as the New Park, was created by James I in 1603, on former Charterhouse lands and the site of the earlier royal park. It is thought that Solomon de Caus may have worked on the gardens of Richmond Palace between 1603 and 1612 (The Old Deer Park 1990). A hunting lodge, Richmond Lodge, was built for James c 1605-6. The park became known as the Old or Little Park when, in 1637, Charles I (1600-49) created his New or Great Park (now known as Richmond Park qv) c 1km to the south.

In c 1721 the Richmond Lodge estate was acquired by George Augustus, Prince of Wales and became the centre of the Royal Court. Five years later, after his accession to the throne, George II gave the estate to Queen Caroline and it became the favourite residence of the royal family. By 1727 Caroline had already made several embellishments to the grounds, employing Charles Bridgeman (d 1738) in favour of Stephen Switzer (1682-1745). William Kent (1684-1748) was also employed at Richmond from c 1730 and designed first a Grotto or Hermitage and by 1735, Merlin's Cave.

In 1731 Frederick, Prince of Wales acquired White House, Kew, to the north of Richmond Lodge and employed William Kent to work on the house and garden. Frederick indulged in his taste for exotic buildings which included Chinese and Indian houses and in the last years of his life began a collection of exotic plants at Kew. Under the care of the Dowager Princess the gardens at Kew developed and were extended. The Princess used Sir William Chambers as her architectural advisor, with Lord Bute providing advice on the botanical collection.

Richmond Lodge estate was inherited in 1760 by George III and became the summer residence of the King and Queen Charlotte. In 1764 George III appointed Lancelot Brown (1716-83) Royal Gardener, and one of his first tasks was alterations to the Richmond Lodge estate. By 1767 the ha-ha had been constructed and by 1770 most of the works of Bridgeman and Kent had been removed, as had the village of West Sheen which stood in the Old Deer Park. The Lodge was found to be too small for the royal family and they moved to the White House. Although members of the royal family had lived in the neighbouring Dutch House (built 1631 by Samuel Fortrey) from 1734 onwards it was not until 1781 that George III bought the freehold of it. After 1802 when the old White House was demolished, Kew Palace, as the Dutch House was now called, became the principal royal residence.

Sir Joseph Banks (1743-1820), President of the Royal Society acted as botanical advisor to George III and with William Aiton (1731-93) as Head Gardener the botanical collection at Kew expanded rapidly. In 1802 the lane that divided the Richmond Lodge gardens and the Kew Palace gardens was closed and the gardens became one unit. By 1841, when the botanic garden was taken over by the state, it was already semi-public. Visitors were admitted daily between 1pm and 6pm, except for Sundays, and there were no admission charges. Under the first Director, Sir William Hooker (1785-1865), the size of the botanic gardens increased to over c 100ha. From 1843 they were relandscaped by William Andrews Nesfield (1793-1881), the architect Decimus Burton (1800-81) working on the buildings.

The 19th century saw many changes at Kew. In 1848 the extension of the London and South-Western Railway from Richmond was built along the south-east boundary of the Old Deer Park. In 1876 the Jodrell Laboratory was founded by the then director of the botanic gardens, Sir Joseph Hooker (1817-1911), son of Sir William Hooker. In 1885, Richmond Town Cricket Club and Athletic Association secured a lease from the Crown of c 3.5ha of land on the south-east side of the Old Deer Park and the Royal Mid-Surrey Golf Course a lease of c 92ha in 1892. In the 1850s the responsibility of Kew passed from the Commissioners of Woods and Forest to the Commissioners of Works and Buildings and in 1898 they instructed the director to extend the opening hours for visitors in the summer.

Between 1903 and 1984 the gardens were administered by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. Under the National Heritage Act 1983 a Board of Trustees were appointed to manage the gardens, an arrangement which continues today (1998).

SUMMARY DESCRIPTION

The Royal Botanic Gardens are located in outer south-west London on the south bank of the River Thames c 500m south west of Kew Bridge. Richmond Park lies c 1km to the south-east with the town of Richmond on the south-east boundary of the Old Deer Park. To the east lies the dense residential development of North Sheen. The River Thames provides the boundary to the west and Kew Green to the north. To the east the grounds are bounded by Kew Road and to the south-east by the railway line.

The Old Deer Park (139ha) is separated from the Botanic Gardens (128ha) by the 18th century ha-ha. The fairly level ground of the Old Deer Park is screened from the river by thick boundary plantings.

The main approach to Kew Gardens is from Kew Green to the north-east through iron gates (listed grade II*) designed in 1848 by Decimus Burton. Numerous other gates provide entrances around the site, most dating from the mid 19th century (and most listed grade II).

The botanic gardens contain many areas of different horticultural and botanic interest. The gardens contains over fifty thousand taxa of living plants from all parts of the world, used for research and education. In addition there is an Herbarium of about six million specimens, an extensive collection of anatomical slides, about one million specimens of plant products, and a comprehensive reference library. The Jodrell Laboratory, nursery, and lecture theatre lies in the north-west corner of the site and provides extensive educational facilities.

A network of paths provide access round the gardens. Five major features dominate the gardens: the Palm House by Decimus Burton with Richard Turner, c 1844(8 (listed grade I), to the east; the Temperate House by Decimus Burton, c 1845-6 (listed grade I) and the Pagoda by Sir William Chambers, c 1761 (listed grade I) to the south; the lake excavated c 1845 to the west; and Kew Palace, formerly known as the Dutch House, c 1631 (listed grade I), to the north. A number of other buildings of historical importance, many from the 18th century by William Chambers for Princess Augusta, survive within the botanic gardens.

To the north of the lake a vista extends from the iron and glass Palm House across the river to Syon House, horticultural interest in this area including the Rhododendron Dell, and the Bamboo and Azalea Gardens. To the south of the lake the paths lead past land set aside for a conservation area, to The Queen's Cottage (listed grade II*) built 1772. The path system continues in a south-easterly direction towards the Temperate House, extended 1898(9 and restored 1978(82, and the Pagoda from where there is a vista north-north-west to the Palm House.

The perimeter path on the east side of the garden leads under the arch (listed grade II* ) designed as a ruin by Chamber c 1760, past the Marianne North Gallery (listed grade II), by James Ferguson c 1882, to the Palm House and Palm House Pond. The Pond, remodelled by Nesfield in 1847, is all that remains of the great lake made for George III which covered the area now occupied by the Palm House and beyond.

From the Palm House the Broad Walk leads north-west back towards the main gate passing to the east the Orangery (listed grade I), by Chambers c 1761 and now (1998) used as a shop and restaurant. Kew Palace (refurbished late 1990s) stands to the north-west flanked on either side by 20th century service buildings, laboratories, and a nursery.

Loss and damage to trees caused by the storms of 1987 and 1990 was considerable but between the Orangery and the Pagoda to the south examples of planting of c 1760 survive.

To the south of Kew Gardens lies the Old Deer Park, physically separated from the botanic gardens by the mid 18th century ha-ha and formally separated in 1841 when Kew Gardens was taken into state control. Much of the parkland to the north is used by the Royal Mid-Surrey Golf Club (founded 1892); the remainder is divided up between the Athletic Ground, open grass recreation ground, tennis courts, and the public swimming pool first opened in 1966. The Royal Observatory (listed grade I) built for George III in 1768(9 to the design of William Chambers lies within the golf course in the north-west part of the park. The Observatory, which maintained its scientific role under a number of owners, closed in 1980. The building continues to be used as offices following its restoration in 1983. The three obelisks or meridian marks (listed grade II), erected in the park in 1778 to enable observation instruments to be adjusted, survive, one near the river bank to the north-west and two near the river bank at the southern tip of the site.

In c 1930 the new Twickenham Road was made, cutting across the south-east corner of the Old Deer Park. A strip of parkland, now (1998) used for car parking, is separated from the main body of the Old Deer Park by the dual carriageway. Access over the road to the park is via a 20th century footbridge.
